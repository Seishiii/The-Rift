                <h3 id="mechanics">The Mechanics of League of Legends</h3>
                <p>
                    The core mechanic in LoL is Farming. Basically, Farming refers to the act of killing minions for gold and using the gold to buy items. Sounds easy right?
                    Well, the main issue is to find a way to Farm effectively while preventing your opponent from doing the same. <br /><br />
                    <b>Last Hitting</b>, just as its name implies, it means being the one to kill a minion. Doing this grants you the gold for killing the minion, creep, or monster.
                    The experience however will be shared between you and any ally close to you. Creep score refers to the amount of minions, creeps, jungle and epic monsters
                    you have killed. It is called CS for short. You should wait for the minion’s health to drop very low before attacking it unless you are actively
                    pushing a lane or clearing a minion wave. Another exception is jungle clearing. Last hitting doesn’t really apply to that. <br />
                    <b>Trading</b>, it refers to the act of dealing and receiving damage to and from your lane opponent during the process of Farming (last hitting) A good trade
                    is generally when you deal more damage than you receive. Remember that minions will attack you when you attack the opponent. Trading is one of the crucial
                    League of Legends mechanics.<br />
                    <b>Warding</b>, you might be thinking of how this influences your farming process. Warding well and correctly allows you to know when you can comfortably farm,
                    push, trade, or just back off. This is because good warding will also let you know the enemy jungler’s location. This will help you avoid ganks almost
                    all the time. As pro-players will say, wards are the single most OP item in the game. Why? Because they give vision in the Fog of War. However, warding
                    will be useless if you are not checking the mini-map every few seconds. Make it a habit to always look at the mini-map.<br />
                    <b>Ganking and Roaming</b>, ganking is the act of going to an ally’s lane to help secure a kill or relieve the pressure on the ally. Junglers are mostly
                    expected to master ganking compared to other laners. When other players apart from the jungler go to another lane to secure a kill, it is called Roaming.
                    Remember that while you can roam to or gank other lanes, it can be done to you too. Warding and playing to the information gotten from the wards are good
                    ways to avoid getting caught unawares.<br />
                    <b>Wave Control</b>, this mechanic refers to manipulating the minion wave in such a way that puts your lane opponent at a disadvantage.
                    A good wave control will force your opponent to choose between getting exposed to danger or losing CS. At the basic levels, there are some things
                    you should understand about wave control and manipulation. They are: <br />
                    <b>Fast Push</b>, this is when you accumulate a large minion wave to quickly push into the enemy. You do this to bait a response from the enemy team.
                    To create a fast push, clear an enemy minion wave but leave the three caster minions. They are weak and will cause your minions to slowly accumulate in
                    that lane.<br />
                    <b>Slow Push</b>, to freeze a wave is to hold a minion wave in such a way that you can farm safely while the enemy gets exposed. Although the wave will
                    inevitably transform into a slow push, it is a good setup for the early game. Freezing a wave requires you to balance the number of minions on both sides.
                    Ensure that your wave is giving out the same amount of damage they are receiving.

                <h4>DO's</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Always keep an eye on the map.</li>
                    <li>Play as a team. You can't win the game by yourself.</li>
                    <li>Keep your composure and focus on the game in order to win.</li>
                    <li>Watch replays of your games. They can help you figure out where you went wrong and what you need to work on.</li>
                    <li>Place wards to expand vision in the jungle.</li>
                    <li>Expand your champion pool. If you wish to climb ranks, having knowledge of handful of champions for each role is the best. This allows you
                        to understand all the different match-ups.</li>
                </ol>
                <br />
                <h4>DONT's</h4>

                    <li>Don't play when you're tilted, it won't end up good in game.</li>
                    <li>Don't steal your jungler's camps, it may result to not getting a gank from your jungler.</li>
                    <li>Don't leave the game / go AFK</li>
                    <li>Don't feed / int (intentional feeding)</li>
